# Christmas Star for Circuit Playground

A simple Neopixel Christmas star project

## Background

This is a basic learning project I have started
with my kids. They had been exposed to [Scratch]( README.md)
and some other visual programming already. I picked
up the [Circuit Playground (Developer Edition)](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3000)
to evaluate it as a first step to working with something 
they could program and do something with.

We were in need of a new topper for our Christmas tree,
and the neopixels (and maybe sound later) on the
Circuit Playground seemed like a good fit.

We created a cardboard backing, a paper star to go in front,
and added a battery pack for the circuit playground. With
all that in place, we have been experimenting
with Neopixel patterns that produce good effects
when diffused through the paper star front.
